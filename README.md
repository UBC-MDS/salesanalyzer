# salesanalyzer

A python package that helps with the analysis on a sales data. The packagage will contain functions to be used as tools for identifying market segment, predicting future sales and analyzing seasonal revenue trends. <br>

> The sales_analyzer package will be an addition to the Python ecosystem as a specialized tool for analyzing retail sales data, targeting small to medium-sized businesses that may not have the resources for an in-house data analytics team and who could benefit from ready-to-use functions for common sales-related tasks. While existing packages such as `Pandas` and `Scikit-learn` provide general tools for data manipulation and machine learning predictions, `salesanalyzer` aims to streamline the process by offering a suite of pre-built, retail-specific analytical functions.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install salesanalyzer
```
